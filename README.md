A simple console-based quiz game in Python covering multiple programming languages (C, C++, Python, Java) with varying difficulty levels.  
Users can select language and difficulty, answer multiple-choice questions, and get their score at the end.

## Features

- Supports 4 programming languages: C, C++, Python, Java
- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Multiple-choice questions with 4 options each
- Randomized question order
- Timed quiz with a countdown timer (optional)
- Score display and feedback
- Simple and interactive command-line interface
